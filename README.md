# 421_Final-Project
Rice Bioe 421/521 Final Project

# Abstract
  The finalized device will be a boxing glove attachment that can log the maximum force and velocity of the user's punch. This will be very useful for training and exercise purposes as it will allow the user to document and thus improve their punches. During a boxing workout it is difficult to make sure you are still going full force once you start getting tired. Having something let you know that your punches are getting weaker and notifying you would be very helpful. Also, having it log your data during each session will allow you to track your progress over the course of time. 
  
The device will primarily run on a Circuit Playground (CP) and have other components connected to it. The Circuit Playground is very useful because it already contains an accelerometer for measurements and can communicate with the wearer using lights and sounds. It will be attached to the arm using an arm band. A capacitive force sensor will be attached along the front of the glove to measure the force of impact. In addition to measuring force, the device will use the accelerometer in the CP to signal when contact occurs and will provide information to determine the speed of the throw. In order to store the info, there will be a data logger attached to the CP. Finally, the user will be able to move the information to their computer for a visual representation of force, velocity, and time.

### Bluetooth helmet
* Play music
* Take pictures
* Make phonecall
* Display speed, display gas info
* Combine with windshield headsup display

### 3D printer
* Know when it fails, alert
* Correct layer shift and fix it
* Print fell off bed and stop the printer
* Adjust the tension on the filament feeder automatically
* When the printer makes moves, it uses its current position to figure out where the next position is and moves in a relative manner
* Automatic bed leveling
* Change flow setting automatically to correct for the failure
* If the motor skips steps, it fixes it. 

###Google glass
* Facial recognition
* Display information 
* From facebook of the person
* Weather
* Have a button take picture, then search up on internet for similar pics/info

### Muscle fatigue tracking suite
* Using EMG  to track signal
* Display info on phone or something

### Party controller
* Set party mode
* Set music, lighting

### Smart bike rack
* Swipe the ID card, if the bike info matches and there is opening, lock
* Student can add other student ID on there for access

### Video chatting mirror
* Would use heads up display technology
* Touch screen?

## **Force measuring boxing gloves**
* **Put a pressure sensor and an accelerometer into the gloves**

### Belt that integrates with Google Maps that vibrates for bikers; maybe can keep track of blindspot
* Actually, scratch that. You have a Pi Board on the top of the bike that has an HUD with salient information about exercise stuff (so it has the salient info of an exercise bike), etc. vibrates on the handlebar with the Google Maps, and automatically flashes the LED in low light situations. Maybe a rearview mirror? Left and right turn signals, you can track location of this pi if it gets lost
* Bike pedaling charges battery pack when not in use
* Combination of lock (track location)
* Rap around on handlebar, when not using, wrap around the wrist
* Vibration wouldnt work, LED may be good
* How are we going to get GPS data? Pure distance? Or how to extract information from google map?

### Make an AI that talks back (akhil this is shitty idea lol)

### Raspberry Pi Dialysis Machine

### Smart toilet
* Trackes urine volume
* Determines turbidity viscosity/concentration

### Leave room reminder
* Ask you bunch of question before leaving room (key? lights?)
* Take a pic for fun
* Could be a key hanger that releases key only after you said what it likes 

### Foot pressure sensing pads
* Measure different pressure at different location of foot using straing gages
* Get bunch of biometric data including steps, walking style, perhaps can infer mood from the data
* Then can generate messages/serach up news and feed it to you based on that info
* Can look at how long you are sitting give suggestions
* Measure pressure during running so it quantifies how hard you run (incorborate accelerometer feature)
* Can tell how durnk you are by looking at how unsteady your steps are
* Calculate average weight of day, advise on weight control over days
* Smart electronics
* Remind you to turn it off
