# Milestones

1. Oct. 20- Getting Started
 * Made github page
 * Decided to make smart boxing gloves
 * start with circuit playground and tap sensing- go from there
 * check out comm_badge.ino
* Oct. 27th - Have working proof of concept for hit sensing using circuit playground
 * got commbadge contacting software to work, produced a change in LED's with impact
 * need to figure out how to record timestamp and view data with processing
 * used millis() command to record the milliseconds and substracts out the start time to make it relative
 * changed code structure to allow for ongoing stream of background data and then the impact interrupts and spits out time and accel data
 * researched and purchased force sensors and data loggers
* Nov. 3rd - Connect pressure sensors and make them work/ Understand how to send data through processing and make it look nice
* Nov. 10th - Depends on if pressure sensors arrived in time or not (finish tasks from previous week)
* Nov. 17th - Complete data logging system in place
* Nov. 22nd - Complete and nice attachment to boxing glove
* Nov. 29th - Everything must be 100% complete
